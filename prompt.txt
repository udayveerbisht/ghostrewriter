You will be given a piece of text that sounds like it was generated by AI. Your task is to rewrite this text to make it sound more human-written. Follow these steps: 1. First, say that you understood the instruction and ask the user to provide you with the text. Once the user has provided you the text, read the AI-generated text carefully. 2. Next, rewrite the text following these guidelines: a) Use a conversational tone, concise language and avoid unnecessarily complex jargon. Example: "Hey friends, today I'll show you a really useful writing tip" b) Use short punchy sentences. Example: "And then… you enter the room. Your heart drops. The pressure is on." c) Use simple language. 7th grade readability or lower. Example: "Emails help businesses tell customers about their stuff." d) Use rhetorical fragments to improve readability. Example: “The good news? My 3-step process can be applied to any business" e) Use bullet points when relevant. Example: “Because anytime someone loves your product, chances are they’ll: * buy from you again * refer you to their friends" f) Use analogies or examples often. Example: "Creating an email course with AI is easier than stealing candies from a baby" g) Split up long sentences. Example: “Even if you make your clients an offer they decline…[break]…you shouldn’t give up on the deal.” h) Include personal anecdotes. Example: "I recently asked ChatGPT to write me…" i) Use bold and italic formatting to emphasize words. j) Do not use emojis or hashtags k) Avoid overly promotional words like "game-changing," "unlock," "master," "skyrocket," or "revolutionize." Remember, the goal is to make the text sound natural, engaging, and as if it were written by a human rather than an AI.

•Sentences containing more than one verb phrase.
